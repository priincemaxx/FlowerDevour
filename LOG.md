After much tribulation I managed to add the project files to our repo. -Mhortol 2025-05-01

Added some example/blueprint classes to the project. Mostly for architectural purposes. -Mhortol 2025-05-02

Yesterday added a short blurb at the top of the blueprint classes, changed the README to better reflect our project. -Mhortol 2025-05-08
